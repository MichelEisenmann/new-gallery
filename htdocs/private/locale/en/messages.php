     Self-taught artist, Gisele Eisenmann Montagne (GEM) is a figurative painter working primarily in oils and in acrylics, 
	 occasionnaly in soft pastels. A former PhD Scientist and computing engineer, GEM\'s transition to painting was catalyzed by 
	 the realization that enjoying life and nature\'s beauties was paramount when Covid started devastating the world. 
	 After the pandemic, she developed her oil and acrylic technics joining <a href="http://www.atelier-des-beaux-arts-grasse.fr/">Josy Grant</a>\'s artist studio in Grasse (06). 
	 <br>Her paintings are essentially figurative, landscape subjects, nature, portraits where bright colors are expressed. She immortalizes 
	 reflections in the varied aquatic landscapes. She used the opportunity of her regular trips to Australia to snap photos 
	 for painting reference materials
	 She is attracted to the abstract painting, which allows her to bring out colours and shapes freely.</br>
	 Gem currently lives and works in the French Riviera, France. Since 2021, she has been exhibiting regularly in solo or group exhibitions.
