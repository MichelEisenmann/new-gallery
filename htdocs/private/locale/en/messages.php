     <h2>Feminine Moments</h2>
	 <p>Feminine Moments is a tribute to the beauty of women in their daily existence, from daydreaming 
	 supervising children at the beach, from dancing to mischievous childhood, 
	 from the wink of connivance between friends to maternal love.</p>
     <p>The exhibition, which also presents some of the latest works, will be held from May 30 to June 12, 2025. 
	 The paintings are available for purchase.

	<h2>Water Mirror</h2><p>
    Water Mirror explores how water and light transform landscapes, creating plays of reflections and shadows. 
	The works often capture peaceful moments in nature that I have reproduced from my photos. Like a mischievous wink, I sometimes 
	add a surreal touch to enrich the view. 
	<br>The exhibition is closed but some paintings are still available for purchase.</br>
    <br>Send an email to contact@giseleeisenmann.com for more information</br>

	'Introduction' => '<p>
     Self-taught artist, Gisele Eisenmann Montagne (signing artist name: GEM) is a figurative painter working primarily 
	 in oils and in acrylics, occasionnaly in soft pastels. A former PhD Scientist and computing engineer, GEM\'s transition
	 to painting was catalyzed by the realization that enjoying life and nature\'s beauties was paramount when the pandemic
	 started devastating the world in 2020. 
	 She developed her oil and acrylic technics joining <a href="http://www.atelier-des-beaux-arts-grasse.fr/">Josy Grant</a>\'s artist studio in Grasse (06). 
	 <br>Her paintings are essentially figurative, landscape subjects, nature, portraits where bright and saturated colors 
	 are expressed. She immortalizes reflections in the varied aquatic landscapes. She used the opportunity of her 
	 regular trips to Australia to snap photos for painting reference materials
	 She is attracted to the abstract painting, which allows her to bring out colours and shapes freely.</br>
	 Gem currently lives and works in the French Riviera, France. Since 2021, she has been exhibiting regularly in solo or group exhibitions.
